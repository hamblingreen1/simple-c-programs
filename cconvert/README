Purpose: Convert units of measurement from imperial to metric through the command line. To be small, fast, well-documented, and demonstrate the life cycle of a simple C program.

Usage: Type in the number of units you need to convert, followed by the unit character according to the following chart:

## Unit | Meaning

i | Inches f | Feet y | Yards m | Miles

Reference: Steve Oualline

Restrictions: Only works for the units listed above. Corresponding metric unit not listed in output.

Roadmap:

* make decimal places configurable
* use full names of units
* include name of metric unit in output
* add exit key/command like 'q' or 'quit'
