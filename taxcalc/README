TaxCalc -- Sales tax calculator

By hamblingreen <hamblingreen@hotmail.com> 

Purpose: Find the added cost of sales tax to a product of a particular price, and display this information in a command-line interface. To be small, fast, well-documented, and demonstrate the life cycle of a simple C program.

Usage: Type in price and (optionally) desired sales tax percentage. The default sales tax percentage is 8%. Enter a blank line to exit.
