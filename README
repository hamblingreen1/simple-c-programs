Simple C Programs
=================
By Hamblingreen

This is a collection of short and sweet programs written in C. I got the prompts
from Steve Oualline's book *Practical C Programming*. The docs are included in each folders README and in the C files themeslves. The comment boxes on the C files are
designed to fit on the Pinephone's screen. These programs are licensed under the
