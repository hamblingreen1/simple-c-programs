Simple C Programs
=================
By Bobby Hamblin

This is a collection of short and sweet programs written in C. I got
the prompts from Steve Oualline's book *Practical C Programming*. The
docs are included in each C file. The comment boxes on the C files are
designed to fit on the Pinephone's screen. These programs are licensed
